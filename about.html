        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>Hello, world! I'm Gurvir Chahal—a student, programmer,
            snowboarder, and more. I enjoy listening to podcasts 
            and keeping myself moving through activities such as 
            weightlifting and swimming.<br><br>
            
            I've always found it challenging to express myself, and 
            I hope this website becomes a space where I can do 
            just that.
            </p><br><br>
            <h1> My Journey</h1>
            <p>Like many people, I had no idea what I wanted to do 
                after high school. I enjoyed math and numbers, so I 
                chose accounting. I spent two semesters in the program
                before realizing it wasn’t for me.
                Instead of dropping out right away, I stayed in 
                accounting but took a few unrelated courses, including 
                an intro to computer science and psychology class. 
                That’s when I was introduced to C++, my first 
                programming language. I quickly fell in love with coding,
                drawn in by the creativity and innovation in the field. 
                Seeing what others had built inspired me to pursue 
                computer science, leading me to transfer into SFU’s 
                Computer Science program—and I haven’t looked 
                back since.</p>
